# My """art"""

A while ago i got gifted an ipad mini by a family member, so out of interest i borrowed my sisters pencil and fell in love with learning how to draw. Drawing for some reason made me really statisfied/happy. So since then i've kept drawing (we're 2 months in now at the time of writing this) and really enjoyed it ever since.

And then recently i've gotten into drawing on paper more, i mainly enjoy using the staedler .5mm fineliners and i also use a mechanical pencil. It's been really nice and improved my line control a lot i feel.

Most of my "art" can be found on my tiktok account (Linked on the homepage). I haven't found a manageable way to keep them stored here so for now thats where they'll be since out of the social media platforms it's by far my favourite to use. I often private what i post because I feel insecure about my abilities, but i'm trying to get better at that.
