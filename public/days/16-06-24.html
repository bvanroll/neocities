    <h1>init</h1>
    <p>At the time of writing this i'm 27/28 y/o living near Ghent (at my parents since house prices are fucked atm).
    My current interests are doing something with this site, journaling (kindof) and glsl shaders.
    The last game i was really into was probably nier replicant earlier this year, and lately i've been playing fallen down from the undertale soundtrack on guitar on loop. 
    It feels really nice to play.</p>
    
    <h2>nier replicant</h2>
    <p>This game was great, i've played nier automata in 2019 i think, something like that and really really enjoyed it. 
    I loved (my interpretations of) the philosophy represented in the game, the art style was great, good VA aswell, great gameplay (close to bayonetta level of gameplay enjoyment), and one of the all time goat soundtracks.
    A masterpiece in my eyes. 
    I really wanted to put nier replicant in the same category, and i still think i do, but i'm conflicted about it.</p>
    
    <p>I loved act 1 of nier replicant a lot more than most if not all parts of nier automata. 
    act 1 introduced me to tons of the characters, but more importantly for me the world.
    In act 1 you travel the world looking for a cure for your sister, going from town to town on an amazing grand adventure.
    The best part for me about this was that every town and area you went had it's own gimmick/twist. 
    Like the <details><summary>forest area</summary> where you experience this amazing text adventure dream state</details>.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately act 2 becomes a lot worse. 
    The story takes a very hopeless turn, which i liked, and there is in general a lot more tragedy (there was already tragedy in act 1, there's just a lot more now), which i liked aswell on it's own.
    However this goes hand in hand with going back to all the old area's to discover their current states, usually linked with some tragedy (which i'm also fine with on it's own) BUT also with an insane amount of enemy spam.
    A lot of these area's in act 1 had some really unique gimmicks, which don't work that well the second time and seem to have been replaced in some cases with more enemies, or in other cases just aren't that fun the second time.
    This really soured the experience for me unfortunately and the combination of getting tearjerked and then raging at the enemy spam being in my way of advancing the story made the whole second act really unenjoyable.
    Compared to automata i also prefered the ending a lot more of automata, however i never got to the post game stuff, i only learned kayne's backstory and got sick of the enemies i kept having to fight.</p>
    
    <p>so thats why i feel conflicted, i should add some screenshots here aswell, which will be for later. Still an amazing game, even if i didn't like act2, and i would highly recommend people playing at least act1, for whatever price tag a AAA level game is worth to you because i feel like it's on that level of enjoyment (or should be, a lot of 3a games aren't that enjoyable to me anymore :/)</p>
