    <h2> my """art""" </h2>
      <p>A while ago i got gifted an ipad mini by a family member, so out of interest i borrowed my sisters pencil and fell in love with learning how to draw. Drawing for some reason made me really statisfied/happy. So since then i've kept drawing (we're 2 months in now at the time of writing this) and really enjoyed it ever since. 

      Here are some of the results: </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="img/tokyo_godfathers.jpeg" alt="painting of a scene from tokyo godfathers">
        <p>this was for a 30 day drawing challenge i'm doing currently. the prompt was to paint a scene or character from your favourite movie so i picked tokyo godfathers.</p>
        <img src="img/eyesmouths.jpeg" alt="painting of a grey little guy with a bunch of eyes and mouths on it's head">
        <p>i got bored of practicing so i decided to turn practice into a piece and draw this thing instead of drawing 90 mouths side by side again :(</p>
        <img src="img/jessepikmin.jpeg" alt="painting of jesse pinkman from breaking bad but his head becomes the top of a pikmin head">
        <p>i just heard the name jesse pikmin from someone and decided to draw it :p</p>
        <img src="img/mouth.jpeg" alt="painting of an open mouth with tons of little mouths, noses, eyes and hands coming out of it">
        <p>this was the same with the practicing thing, got bored and decided to incorporate it into a piece</p>
        <img src="img/night.jpeg" alt="painting of a giant purple guy with a theatre mask trying to grab a normal guy who is getting beamed up">
        <p>idk what to say about this/what it is, i just thought of this scene. probably some of my cleanest lineart but man i hate lineart</p>
        <img src="img/signalis_inspo.jpeg" alt="painting of a grey monster thing with a little blood, body looks like how the bodies look in the game signalis">
        <p>wanted to draw a full body of something and was failing all day, at the end of the day thought of a scene that reminedd me of signalis and painted that</p>
        <img src="img/glados.jpeg" alt="painting of glados">
        <p>i had to retry glados 5 times because the geometry was fucking with my brain, this was the only time it worked. it's also only using 2 hue's (i think)</p>
        <img src="img/miku_head.jpeg" alt="painting of a giant hatsune miku head skating">
        <p>this frame came from a tiktok. when i started out i drew frames from tiktoks that i found.</p>
        <img src="img/selfportrait.jpeg" alt="a self portrait">
        <p>also from a drawing challenge, had to do a self portrait, and decided (which i regret) doing it "realistic".</p>
        <img src="img/teeth.jpeg" alt="painting of a person opening their mouth">
        <p>second attempt at drawing teeth, i think it worked out well</p>
        <img src="img/turnip_the_clown.jpeg" alt="painting of turnip the clown">
        <p>another frame from a tiktok, from tiktokker turnip the clown this time</p>
